# EXCEL-PROJECT-1-BIKE-SALES-ANALYSIS
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset consists of various factors related to customers and their purchasing behavior. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing within Excel to ensure data quality and consistency. Utilizing Excel's pivot tables and charting features, I have created visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to different aspects of the dataset. This project culminates in a visual dashboard created entirely within Excel. This interactive dashboard provides an overview of the sales data and allows users to explore key metrics and trends.

The dataset contains the following columns:
1) ID                                    : Customer ID
2) Marital Status                        : Marital status of the customer

PROJECT OVERVIEW:-

1. CLEANED-SOURCE DATA                   : Contains the original data cleaned and prepared for analysis.
2. PIVOT TABLES                          : Contains pivot tables summarizing the bike sales data.
3. DASHBOARD                             : Visual dashboard summarizing key insights and trends.


ANALYSIS AND RESULTS:- 

Based on the dashboard analysis of the bike sales data, here we can observe several key insights. The dataset reveals that the majority of bike purchases are made by middle-aged individuals, with the highest concentration of customers falling between the ages of 30 and 50. At the same time, this age group shows a balanced distribution of bike purchases across both genders, with nearly equal proportions of male and female buyers. This indicates that middle-aged adults, irrespective of gender, are the primary target market for bike sales.

Now when it is about marital status and education level, it also play significant roles in bike purchasing behavior. Married individuals are more likely to purchase bikes compared to their single individuals, suggesting that family-oriented marketing strategies could be effective. Additionally, customers with higher education levels, such as those with bachelors or higher degrees, show a greater tendency to purchase bikes. This correlation between higher education and bike purchases suggests that educated individuals might be environmentally aware and based on trends, driving their decision to buy bikes.

At last, Geographical and income analyses highlight further trends. Customers residing in urban regions with shorter commute distances are more inclined to purchase bikes, likely due to the biking in congested city environments. Higher income groups also shows an interest to buy bikes, indicating that disposable income positively influences purchasing decisions. These insights collectively suggest that marketing efforts should focus on urban, middle-aged, educated, and higher-income demographics to maximize and better bike sales output.
